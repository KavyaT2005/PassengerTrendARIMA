# PassengerTrendARIMA
A data analysis and forecasting project using the AirPassengers dataset to model airline passenger trends from 1949â€“1960. The project leverages R with libraries such as timeSeries, forecast, and astsa to explore time series characteristics, stabilize variance, and forecast future passenger demand using ARIMA and SARIMA models.
